1) Place the files on a server or a use a local test server. (EG: run 'php -S localhost:8080')
2) By default, it uses a database called "local_db" on 127.0.0.1 (localhost) with user root and no password. 
This can be changed by adjusting the variables in endpoint.php
3) Make sure your SQL user has INSERT and SELECT privileges on the local_db database.
